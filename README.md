# Weather Dashboard

This project was developed with ReactJS and `@salesforce/lightning-design-system`. As this application is using webpack, using css would require more time. I was able to create my stylesheet but that could not be used yet in this application. That would be a todo for future.

While I would have loved to spend a significant amount of time properly injecting asset dependencies from the lightning design system into the build pipeline (webpack), I chose to copy them directly out of the package into a assest folder. This application is susceptible to code rot when the lightning design system is updated, therefore it should not be used as an example for using the lightning design system. It was inteded for prototype and demonstration purpose only - that I am capable of writing clean enough code and am comfortable learning a new technology.

Future Todo: Adding icons and be able to display data for everyday in one card view.

## Introduction

Using this app user would be able to see weather information of 4 cities. 

During this project http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?q=${city}&units=metric&cnt=7&appid=${openWeatherApiKey}` api was used to get data in json format and every every day data was processed and displayed according. 

## Challenges
During this project, i faced most challenges in setting up @salesforce/lightning-design-system with my existing React boiler plate. 
Finding the right version number of libraries.
Dropdown event is not getting triggered and i have identified that as a future version.
